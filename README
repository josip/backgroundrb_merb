= Why double fork?
Well, to original fork didn't work for me...

= Merb fork of BackgrounDRb
Based on the 1.0.3 version of backgroundrb this is a hacked port to MERB.  Some areas need tyding up but it works for all basic cases.  Contributions welcome!

== Installation
  (1) Install gem provided in /pkg into your app's gem repository (which has to be named gems)
      ex. #cd ~/path/to/app
          #mkdir gems
          #gem install ~/path/to/bdrb_merb.gem -i gems --no-ri --no-rdoc -l
  (2) Create blank config/backgroundrb.yml file
  (3) Generate new worker, so that you get correct backgroundrb.yml file
        #cd ~/pat/to/app
        #merb-gen worker Test
        (You whish to overwrite config/backgroundrb.yml)
        #rm app/workers/test_worker.rb
        #rm spec/workers/test.rb
== Usage
  Workers are created in app/workers
  To create new worker:
    merb-gen worker WorkerName

  To start BackgroundRB:
    rake bdrb:ctl:start
    Control+C to stop
  To run in background:
    rake bdrb:ctl:daemonize
  And to stop it:
    rake bdrb:ctl:stop

= BackgrounDRb
BackgrounDRb is a Ruby job server and scheduler. Its main intent is to be
used with Ruby on Rails applications for offloading long-running tasks.
Since a Rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced
from http request/response cycle.

This new release of BackgrounDRb is also modular and can be used without Rails so that any Ruby program or framework can use it.
