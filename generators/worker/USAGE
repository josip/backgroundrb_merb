Description:
    The worker generator creates stubs for a new BackgrounDRb worker.

    The generator takes a worker name as its argument.  The worker name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Worker'.

    The generator creates a worker class in app/workers and a test suite in
    test/unit.

Example:
    merb-gen worker Tail

    This will create an Tail worker:
        Model:      app/workers/tail_worker.rb
        Test:       spec/workers/tail_spec.rb
